The objective of the project was to create a public library of 3D orbit simulations of satellites, space missions and other celestial objects in our solar system. The end-user can input how many celestial bodies affect the orbit (Eg: The Sun and Moonâ€™s effect on Satellite orbits, J2 and J4 propagation) and observe how the orbit changes.
