The objective of the project was to create a public library of 3D orbit simulations of satellites, space missions and other celestial objects in our solar system; the end-user can input how many celestial bodies affect the orbit (Eg: The Sun and Moonâ€™s effect on Satellite orbits, J2 and J4 propagation) and observe how the orbit changes.

## Contents
- Apollo 11 - contains MATLAB code of the simulation of Apollo 11's orbit
- ISS - contains MATLAB code of the simulation of the International Space station's orbit and ground track
- Chandrayaan 2 - contains MATLAB code of the simulation of Chandrayaan 2's orbit
